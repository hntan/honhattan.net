I'm 29 year old now, I has been working as a software engineer for more than seven years. And you know; this is my third company that I'm been working during my whole career, I got some quite interviews still now. I had to admit that I'm not a really good software engineer, I don't have a deep knowledge to what I'm been working on. One reason would be impatience and didn't spend more time on researching things. 

So here am I, I got an idea how to be a little better at programing. that is doing a **30-Day Challenges**. 


This is my first 30-Day Challenges: research in deep and publish a technical article about t every day. that could be a technology that I already known or did not know yet.
